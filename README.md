# Implementation of the Prototype
## Implementation as Interface Validator
This prototype refers to the one discussed in chapter 3.2 of my bachelor's thesis "Generating Interfaces for Microservice Communication from Interface Specifications".

The prototype is rudimentary and only service the purpose of exploring the former created IDL and its implementation possibilities.
